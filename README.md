# exertus
A simple no-nonsense command-line app to choose exercises to perform at random

# History
I started developing this app as I wanted a simple prompt that I can use during breaks between Pomodoros to choose exercises I can do in my home office to get more movement integrated into my day.

While it's extremely simple at this point, I hope to eventually integrate motivational statements, exercise recording, report generation, and more.
